# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
We invite everyone to participate in our project, irrespective of who they are or where they come from, as long as their contributions are focused solely on the project and its goals. We are here to discuss elKalendar, its direction, and the code surrounding it—nothing else. We celebrate diversity and welcome differences, judging only the quality of the code submitted, never making it personal.

To put it simply: don’t be difficult—we’re here to create something beneficial and useful for the world. Leave personal matters aside and let's focus on what brings us together.


#### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

#### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Engaging in discussions about politics, culture, gender, ethnicity, etc., that are unrelated to the project.
- Using sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They can also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [your contact email]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
